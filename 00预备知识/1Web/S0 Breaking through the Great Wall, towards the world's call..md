# S0 Breaking through the Great Wall, towards the world's call

keywords: GFW, VPN, VPS, GitHub, legal

---

GFW(the great fire wall) has become a boundary whose function has shifted from protection to restriction.

The author of this section believes that as a mature and responsible individual, it's a must to gain the ability to access information from multiple resources and differentiate or process it.

> For your safety, this section provides several tools to get access to "outside" legally, if not, please contact with author AT ONCE.

## The paradox of "Ladder"

One cannot find a way out and search for a "ladder" unless he/she has already had one since disseminating a "ladder" to others is illegal domestically.

However, one can still legally reach places that are far beyond the GFW, such as GitHub, with proper tools.

## Get access to GitHub

### Modify Hosts

The 'hosts' file is a file without a suffix containing a table that links IP addresses and domains. A system will always check the file first when accessing target domains.

### Application: Watt Toolkit

> Watt Toolkit is not only for Steam players!

### Blogs of 羽翼城|Dogfight360

Once you have installed the tools and made full use of them, you will be able to download other tools, including the "ladder," to cross the GFW.

For more information, please consult your available search engine.

P.S. you can also rent a VPS to build your own connection.



Congratulations in advance! The world is open to you now, with just a few steps!
